NTU Cmlab: Project BackingTouch
[Core Functions]

1.Before developing, please Download Openframework for iPhone from:
http://www.openframeworks.cc/versions/preRelease_v0.07/of_preRelease_v007_iphone.zip

2.After checkout, please place the two directory under /of_preRelease_v007_iphone/apps/iPhoneSpecificExamples/

3.For BackingTouchBack, Please modify /testApp.h:9 #define HOST "DNIPhone.local" to the hostname of  your front iPhone.

4.Make sure that the two devices (Front and Back) are in the same subnet of wi-fi, so that they can communicate with each others.

Contact me if you have any problems.
